  - Bundle selection (start of run)
  - Card compendium (library)

## Installation

### Download

Download the latest zip from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vasia123/STS2-SmartPickMod/releases) or [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/slaythespire2).

1. Extract all files to `Slay the Spire 2/mods/`
2. Enable in game: **Settings > Modding > SmartPick > Restart**

### Build from source

1. **Build the mod** (requires [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) and [Godot 4.5 .NET](https://godotengine.org/download)):

   ```
   dotnet build SmartPick.csproj
   ```

   This copies `SmartPick.dll`, `SmartPick.pck`, and `SmartPick.json` into your game's `mods\` folder.

2. **Enable the mod in-game:** Settings > Modding > Enable **SmartPick** > Restart.

> If the build fails with "file is being used by another process", close the game first.

## Configuration

If your game is not in the default Steam location, create `local.props`:

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <STS2GamePath>D:\YourPath\Slay the Spire 2</STS2GamePath>
    <GodotExePath>C:\Path\To\Godot_v4.5-stable_mono_win64.exe</GodotExePath>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

## How it works

The mod uses [HarmonyLib](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to hook into game screens and attaches Godot UI elements (tier badges) to card nodes. Card identity is read directly from the game's `CardModel` — no heuristics or name parsing needed.

Tier data from two community sources is embedded in the DLL as JSON resources and blended into a single S/A/B/C/D rating per card per character.

## Data sources

- **[Mobalytics](https://mobalytics.gg/slay-the-spire-2/tier-lists/cards)** — card tier list
- **[slaythespire-2.com](https://slaythespire-2.com/card-tier)** — community wiki card tiers
- **[Mobalytics](https://mobalytics.gg/slay-the-spire-2/tier-lists/relics)** — relic tier list

Tier list JSONs are in `data/tier_lists/`. Or use the in-game editor (F7) to customize ratings.
